    <h1>Welcome to PWA CalcPioneer</h1>
    <p>Please understand that I've created this application primarily for my personal education and testing. While others are welcome to use and test it if they wish, please be aware that it's not specifically designed for wider use, and any usage is at one's own risk. I can't guarantee that the application will work as intended. It's still a prototype and in its testing phase, meaning it may have bugs and its features might change. I'm continuously working on improving it, but for now, it shouldn't be relied upon for any tasks. Your interest and support are appreciated, and I hope to present a more polished version in the future!</p>
